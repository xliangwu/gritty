An LGPL java swing terminal widget that actually works properly. Started off with [JCTerm](http://www.jcraft.com/jcterm/index.html) from jcraft.org but almost entirely rewritten.


Supports:
  * ssh using [JSch](http://www.jcraft.com/jsch/index.html) from jcraft.org
  * vt102 emulation
  * xterm colours
  * back buffer so selection / cut and paste works
  * scroll buffer
  * terminal resizing from client or server side


Coming soon:
  * Telnet
  * More compatibility with real terminals ( ie unix programs)
  * xterm mouse tracking


You can use it in your free or commercial projects.

Try it right now with [webstart](http://gritty.googlecode.com/files/gritty-0.01.jnlp).
